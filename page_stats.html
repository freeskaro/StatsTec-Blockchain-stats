	<h2> PCA Analysis</h2><br>
	<div class="container">
		<p >It is well known in crypto currency markets that when Bitcoin moves up or down the rest of the market follows, mostly.
		Principal component analysis (PCA) can help determine how much of the market movement is correlated. Some groups of coins such as Ethereum, 
		NEO, and at times DASH and Monero have moved differently from Bitcoin. These different groups can be identified (to some degree)
		in the eigen vectors of the PCA. For each eigen vector, the amplitude coefficients show its dominance in the market at any given time. 
		This analysis uses the covariance matrix of the normalized dataset (as plotted above). <span style="color:brown"> Please wait for the data to load, execute the analysis and view the results below.</span></p>

		<h2>Results </h2>
		<p >Here we keep a running record of conclusions drawn for the data. Since crypo markets change dramatically, and only a short 3 month data window is followed here, comments are periodically moved from here 
		   the technical blog at  <a href="http://www.statstec.ca">statstec.ca</a>. In PCA analysis, a centred version of the normalized data set can be rebuilt by multiplying the eigenvectors (EG listed in Appendix) by 
		   their amplitude scores (the curves 'a' above). Note that a negative EG1 coefficient multiplied by a negative amplitude score indicates price increase. In the plot above, the zero value of the amplitude curves represents a mean (sort of).
		   From the results, typically over 90% of the information can be reconstructed with 4 eigenvectors. Also, EG1 represents typically about 80% of variations in the market. The coefficients of EG1 are all negative for every coin, except for Tether. 
		   It represents correlated market movements and perhaps indirectly money in the market.EG2 and E3 typically represents around 10% and 5% of variations in market, respectively. Here coins like NEM, and Binance, or Ethereum, NEO, and Stellar, are negatively correlated to Bitcoin and other coins. 
			Amplitude curves 'a2' and 'a3' represent a certain proportion of money that moves toward or away from these coins to the others. (similar analysis applies to EG4). In the 4 cluster results below, positive value are daily positive price change (ie slope of price curve).
			</p>
		   

		<p >(2018-04-13) Results discussion - </p>
		<ul>
		<li>From both the 6 months and 3 month analysis, the amplitudes for EG1, curve 'a1', appears to have levelled off; ie, the market has arrived at where it was headed.</li>
		<li>From the 4 cluster results below, it appears that the bottom peaks are steadily reducing; ie, the number and magnitude of price drops.</li>
		<li>This suggest a bull period coming. Price drops are being replaced by price flats and price swings by flat to jump.</li>
		<li>Also from the clusters below, there appears to be a long cycle and short cycle in price movement. The short cycle has about 4 days positive and 4 days negative. The long cycle is defined by the lower dips within which there can be one or two smaller dips.</li>
		</ul>
		<p >(2018-04-20) Results discussion - </p>
		<ul>
		<li>Last time the 'a1' curve was at the same value was on March 6. Then, Bitcoin was $10800. Currently its at $8900. So its lost 20% to alts (The movements in curves 'a2' and 'a3' etc).</li>
		<li>The momentum has swung back in favour of BTC a bit today, explaining somewhat the sudden surge.</li>
		</ul>
		<p >(2018-04-25) Results discussion - </p>
		<ul>
		<li>A new wave in crypto markets: BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, now old and non-shiny. Money moving into EOS, Cardano, Binance, NEM, Loopring etc. See EG2 (vector 2) in appendix.</li>
		<li>Possible ending of 'long cycle' today. Market bullishness and volatility may be giving away to a small correction</li>
		</ul>
		<p >(2018-05-17) Results discussion - </p>
		<ul>
		<li>Market is retreating but appears to leveling off. Bitcoin has regained ground relative to alt coins.</li>
		<li>Possible 'long cycle' negative peak passed. Market bullishness probably to return</li>
		</ul>

	<h2> Cluster Analysis</h2>
	<div class="container">
		<p >Cluster analysis seeks to identify groups in the dataset: data points that are close to each other and far from other groups.
		The top 100 crypto-currencies do not form well defined different groups. Rather they form one big group with fuzzy edges and outliers. 
		To try to form meaningful groups we have done 2 things: (1) the 3-day average price change is used as the clustering variable; 
		and,(2) PCA analysis is preformed on this data set to reduce the number or variables for clustering. Here, the k-means clustering algorithm
		is used to make 4 clusters based on the first 4 eigenvectors. For interesting results, the 3-day average price change is presented with the 3-day average volume.
		<span style="color:brown"> Please try a few iterations to find interesting clusters. 
		Pumping coins appear in small outlier cluster of 2 to 4 coins and show an up-tick at the end of the time series. </span> 
		The cluster assignments can be found below in the appendix. Go back to the first chart to plot individual cluster members.</p>
